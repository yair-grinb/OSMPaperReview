# OSMPaperReview
A repository for analyzing OSM-related publications from the years 2016-2019, as presented in the paper "Bridges and Barriers: An Exploration of Engagements of the Research Community with the OpenStreetMap Community" by A. Yair Griberger, Marco Minghini, Godwin Yeboah, Levente Juh√°sz, and Peter Mooney (submitted to the ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information). 

**data:** the dataset is publicly available for download at https://zenodo.org/record/4474588#.YBJP-OgzZPZ

**analyze_review.py:** reads the initial data file into a pandas DataFrame, produces a summary table, prints out some discriptive statistics, and produces additional files used to produce alluvial diagrams using https://rawgraphs.io/.

**osm_review_figures.Rmd:** reads the initial data file into a data frame, corrects country names, generates the study area continents columns, and produces three figures: map of authors' home locations (# papers per country), map of study area locations (# papers per country), circular chord diagram connecting author locations and study areas by number of papers at the continental level.
